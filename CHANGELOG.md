# Changelog

## 0.2.1 (2026-09-26)

**Removed the input mask.** It masked the requirement *inside the composer draft*
(a random-length "waaaaaaaagh", revealed by a second Enter), so the text the model
received depended on the ordering between the plugin restoring the draft and the
composer bar reading it for its own submit — a race that could send the mask
instead of the requirement. The plugin never writes to the draft now:

- Typing, the input box and the submitted payload are untouched: what you type is
  what gets sent, always.
- The Ork head is decorative again — no click-to-reveal, no second Enter, and it
  no longer swallows composer pointer events.
- The output mask, running indicator, green skin, process-row icons, placeholder
  cycling and the custom-avatar setting are unchanged.

(0.2.0 was never published to npm.)

## 0.2.0 (2026-09-21)

Adapted to DSH 0.1.6-alpha.2 (web) and 0.1.7-rc.2 (desktop):

- Input mask now intercepts the composer's own submit path (capture-phase Enter
  / primary-button click) instead of wrapping the slot's `inputActions.submit`,
  which the composer bar stopped using; the requirement is still revealed by
  clicking the Ork and never reaches the model as "waaaaagh".
- Running indicator follows the 0.1.7 layout: the polite live region became
  screen-reader-only, so the visible running label in the current turn-process
  row is located at runtime and becomes "Waaaaaaagh!!!" (the 0.1.6 visible
  status element is still handled).
- Composer placeholder: the Lexical composer renders `[data-composer-placeholder]`
  instead of a `textarea::placeholder`, which the green skin and the cycling Ork
  words now target (through a CSS variable, so React's render is untouched).
- Send button: green "Waaagh!" pill also covers the busy-state labels
  (排队发送 / 插话发送 / Queue message / Steer message); the stop button keeps
  its square icon.
- `dsh.client` declaration refreshed: dropped the removed
  `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-runtime` inject edge, added the real UI rows and
  stage-one prefetch; peer ranges now name 0.1.6-alpha.2+.
- Slash-command drafts (`/…`) are never masked.

Engineering (no behaviour change):

- The browser half is TypeScript under `src/client/`; `lib/client.js` and
  `lib/index.js` are esbuild build products (`pnpm run build`) instead of
  hand-edited bundles. Sprites live in `src/assets/` and are inlined at build.
- `pnpm run typecheck` checks slot names and props against the published
  `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-*` declarations (devDependencies pinned to
  0.1.7-rc.2), so a wrong slot key or state field fails the compiler instead of
  the page.
- CI installs, typechecks, rebuilds and then asserts `lib/` has no drift from
  `src/`; `prepublishOnly` rebuilds before every publish.

## 0.1.4 (2026-08-29)

- Tool / context / compaction process rows now show a green Ork head instead of the default leading icon.
- Tool errors keep a red ring so a failed call stays readable.

## 0.1.1 (2026-08-29)

- Ork sprite now sits flush against the composer's left edge.
- Clicking a masked `Waaaaaaagh!!!` message reveals the original text.
- Simplified the README.
- Published to npm.

## 0.1.0 (2026-08-29)

- Initial release: green pixel-Ork mascot, input mask, output mask, custom avatar, and a green "Deep diving..." indicator.
